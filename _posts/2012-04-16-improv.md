My 12 year old daughter has been participating for several weeks now in an improvisational acting class.  I did not know much about improv except the obvious bits all of us “non-actors” know... no script, have to think on your feet, have to be really brilliant etc.  Well it was eye opening to me to hear the science and process behind improv and I was really inspired to observe the similarities between the 5 rules of imrov and the rules of any productive brainstorming session.

This is a nice post on the 5 rules of improv, probably there are many articles such as this, I did not find it particuarly remakable except it appeared relatively high in Google search results:

I won't go into each, but as you read these you could easily see the parallels to basic brainstorming:

1. Don't deny.
2. Don't ask open ended questions (okay, maybe this does not fit well as a brainstorming rule?).
3. You don't have to be funny (in the case of brainstorming perhaps replace “funny” with “brilliant”.
4. You can look good if you make your partner look good (good listening, pivot from or build on good ideas).
5. Tell a story (keep on track, bring the good ideas back to the theme/task).
