I am looking forward to getting back to my research and hopefully write some prose. So far I have what I think can be the kernel of a good sci fi thriller. Reading still Dramatica and initial thoughts on Dramatica's story-mind are that it can serve as an excellent straw-man for a story. Certainly has given me a lot of food for thought when it comes to forming up the "players" in the story.
